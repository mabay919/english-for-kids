# English for kids

*SPA*
>Main features:
>The application works in training mode and in game mode.  
>When you click on the card, the pronunciation of the word in English sounds.  
>Each card has a button that, when clicked, turns the card over. The translation of the word is placed on the back of the card.  
>When you click on the back of the card, nothing happens, the pronunciation of the word does not sound.  
>The reverse rotation of the card to the front side occurs automatically when the mouse cursor moves beyond its borders.  
>The card with the guessed word becomes inactive, while its appearance changes.  
>After the start of the game, each click on the active card is a correct or incorrect answer. These responses are displayed as asterisks.  
>If there are too many stars and the scale is completely filled with them, the previous stars are hidden, and new ones continue to be added.
